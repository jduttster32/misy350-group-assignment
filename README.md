Description: For our project, we will be creating a 2 table database. One of these tables will hold a professional quarterbacks name, height, weight and team name. The second table will contain the stats for this player. These stats will include qb name, rating, number of passing yards and team record. This will be a one to many relationship. For one player, there are many statistics.
