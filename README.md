Description: For our project, we will be creating a 2 table database for an intramural basketball team. One of these tables will hold all the player names, height, weight and position. The second table will contain the stats for this player. These stats will include field goal percentage, 3-point percentage, overall player rating along with the player name that these stats belong to. This will be a one to many relationship. For one player, there are many statistics.
